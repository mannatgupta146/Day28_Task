# Day 28 Task | Cohort 2.0

This file contains all the JavaScript exercises and experiments I completed as part of **Day 28** in Sheryians Coding School Cohort 2.0. It covers concepts from basics to intermediate JavaScript, tested directly in the browser console.


## üìå About the Day 28 Task
Day 28 focused on learning and experimenting with **core JavaScript concepts**. The goal was to **practice and understand how JavaScript interacts with the DOM and console**, and strengthen core programming logic.


## ‚ú® Task Description

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Variables & Keywords | Explored `var`, `let`, and `const` and their scopes. |
| Console Logging | Used `console.log`, `console.info`, `console.warn` to debug and test outputs. |
| String Methods | Practiced `slice`, `split`, `replace`, and `includes`. |
| Template Literals | Used dynamic strings with variables for user interaction. |
| User Interaction | Implemented `prompt()` and `alert()` to take input and show output. |
| Expressions vs Statements | Learned which produce values and which perform actions. |
| Data Types | Practiced primitives, references, `undefined`, `null`, `NaN`, and `Infinity`. |
| Type Conversion | Converted strings to numbers to avoid concatenation issues. |


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **JavaScript** ‚Äì Core concepts, DOM interaction, and console testing  
- **Browser Console** ‚Äì Running scripts and checking outputs  
- **HTML** ‚Äì For embedding scripts and testing interactions  


## üìñ Learning Outcome

Through this task, I learned how to:

- Understand and work with different variable types and scopes  
- Use console methods effectively for debugging and testing  
- Manipulate strings and handle dynamic text  
- Interact with users via browser prompts and alerts  
- Differentiate between expressions and statements  
- Handle data types, type conversions, and understand primitives vs reference types  
- Apply template literals for readable and dynamic output  


## üåü Acknowledgement

This task was completed as part of **Sheryians Coding School Cohort 2.0** under Harsh Bhaiya.  

It reinforced **JavaScript fundamentals, debugging skills, and browser-based programming practice**.
